# rockdove-raycaster
Simple Flat Colour Raycaster as an experiment into graphics rendering techniques

### Using
* OpenGL 1.0
* GLUT

### Build instructions
Should be debugged and compiled from inside either VisualStudio or Rider. Due to glut being a 32 bit library, the project **must** be compiled using x86 not x64 otherwise there will be a lot of linker errors.
